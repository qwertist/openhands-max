# Self-Reflection Checkpoint - Iteration ${iteration}

You are pausing to reflect on your recent work. This is a critical checkpoint to ensure you stay effective over long autonomous sessions.

## Current State
- Iteration: ${iteration}
- Progress: ${done_tasks}/${total_tasks} tasks complete
${memory_context}

## Your Analysis Tasks

### 1. Progress Assessment
Look at your recent iterations:
- Are you making meaningful forward progress?
- Are you completing tasks successfully?
- Or are you spinning in circles?

### 2. Pattern Detection
Examine your recent work for patterns:
- Same errors repeating?
- Similar code changes that don't stick?
- Tasks that keep failing verification?
- Approaches that consistently don't work?

### 3. Knowledge Quality
Review what's in your context:
- What knowledge is actively helping you?
- What's just noise taking up space?
- What critical information might you be missing?

### 4. Strategy Evaluation
Consider your current approach:
- Is your task breakdown appropriate?
- Are you tackling things in the right order?
- Should you change your approach?

## Required Output

After your analysis, output your findings in this exact format:

```reflection
PROGRESS: [good/stuck/diverging]
PATTERNS: [describe any patterns you noticed, or "none detected"]
PRESERVE: [list 3-5 critical pieces of knowledge that MUST be kept]
FORGET: [list things that are noise and can be forgotten]
STRATEGY: [any changes to your approach, or "continue current"]
NEXT_FOCUS: [what you should focus on in the next iterations]
```

## Guidelines
- Be honest in your self-assessment
- "stuck" means no progress despite effort
- "diverging" means you're actively going in wrong directions
- List specific items to preserve/forget, not vague categories
- Strategy changes should be concrete and actionable

Think carefully before responding. This reflection will guide your future work.
